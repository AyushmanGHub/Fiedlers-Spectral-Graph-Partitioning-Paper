## 📊 Fiedler's Theory of Spectral Graph Partitioning

This repository offers an in-depth exploration of **Fiedler’s Theory of Spectral Graph Partitioning** — a foundational technique in graph theory and network analysis. It divides a graph into balanced, meaningful, and connected subgraphs using the properties of the **second smallest eigenvalue** (the **Fiedler value**) and its associated **Fiedler vector**.


## 📖 Overview
**Spectral Graph Partitioning** leverages the spectral properties of a graph’s **Laplacian matrix** to efficiently partition its vertices.

This project covers:
* 📘 The theoretical foundation as introduced by **Miroslav Fiedler**.
* ✅ A complete mathematical proof ensuring partition correctness and connectivity.
* 🧮 Python implementation of spectral partitioning on example graphs.
* 🌍 Real-world applications, key limitations, and directions for further exploration.

## 📚 Theory Highlights

* Constructs the **graph Laplacian matrix** from adjacency and degree matrices.
* Computes the **second smallest eigenvalue (λ₂)** — the **Fiedler value**.
* Uses the **Fiedler vector** (eigenvector of λ₂) to partition nodes based on the **signs of its entries**.
* The partitioning:
  * Minimizes the number of cut edges between groups.
  * Maintains a balanced size between the resulting partitions.
  * Ensures subgraphs remain **connected**, as proven mathematically.
